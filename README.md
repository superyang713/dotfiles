### Installation

Because new shell (zsh) is installed, the script will not run all the way. So
the installation is involved in two parts.
First, use the following command:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superyang713/vimrc-and-plugins/master/install.sh)
```

Once it is done, type:

```
exit
zsh
```
